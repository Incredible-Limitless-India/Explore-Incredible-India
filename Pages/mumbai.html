            The geographical land area that makes up Mumbai today was actually spread over seven different islands, which were home to fishing communities for many centuries. These islands were initially under the control of successive indigenous empires and then were ceded first to the Portuguese and eventually moved to the British East India Company. During the mid-18th century, the Hornby Vellard Project was launched where major roads and railways were constructed over the sea to connect these seven islands in one of the biggest land reclamation development drives in India. This move consolidated all the land and created a city that went on to become a major sea port in the Arabian Sea, eventually aiding its transformation into an economic and trading giant. Upon India’s independence in 1947, this city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital. Bombay was renamed Mumbai in 1996.
